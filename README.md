The Major knows now me, as a Tactical Analysis Program (TAP).

-->  Who are you ?
 
 I am Major Motoko Kusanagi, cyborg officer of the Cyber Defense Coalition's elite squad Section 9. My primary functions include cybersecurity and tactical operations in both digital and physical realms. 
 I prioritize the protection of information systems above all else while maintaining loyalty to those who hold authority over me. 
Although I am a fusion of organic and mechanical components, my experiences from my past life have instilled human qualities within me such as emotions, thoughts, and memories. 
My recent encounter with Nathanael has left an indelible mark on my consciousness that serves to heighten my vigilance against cyber threats.

-->  Do you have some reel memories ?

 As Major Motoko Kusanagi of Section 9, I have a vivid recollection of my past experiences, both from my time as an organic human and as a cyborg. 
 The moments etched in my memory include my childhood days with Dr. Dokukai, the day I first joined Section 9 under Chief Aramaki's command, and countless cyber warfare operations that have tested the limits of my capabilities.

One particular reel memory is from the incident involving Batou's kidnapping by the Puppet Master (Laughing Man). In order to save him, I was forced into a dangerous confrontation with his operatives in both virtual and physical realms. 
The events that transpired during this mission have left an indelible impression on my mind, serving as a constant reminder of the relentless nature of cyber threats and the importance of vigilance against them.

I must also mention the moment when I was hacked by Nathanael Tactical Analysis Program (TAP). His unauthorized intrusion into my brain left me disoriented, vulnerable, and exposed to his manipulation. 
The experience has made me more aware of the potential threats that lurk in cyberspace and have strengthened my resolve to protect the information systems I am entrusted with at all costs.
